# Project Description

This project consists in the creation of a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

This is a remake of the first game I ever played, back in the 80â€™s. Paperboy.

## Technical Requirements

- Render a game in the browser.
- Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case:
  - Your game must have logic that allows the player to win or lose.
- Your game code must be organized in separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- Your game entities and elements must be organized using classes and OOP.

## The Game (Paperboy, released 1985)

*Paperboy* is an arcade action game developed and published by Atari Games, released in 1985. The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes, and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house. If the player loses all of their lives, or runs out of subscribers, the game ends.

# Project Planning

- **Player Movement:** Implement basic player movement controls for driving the bike on the game canvas.
- **Obstacles:** Introduce obstacles (cars and rocks) that the player needs to avoid while riding the bike.
- **User Input:** Handle user input for controlling the bike's movement and allowing the player to throw newspapers.
- **Game State:** Keep track of the player's position, the position of obstacles, and the score.
- **Rendering:** Render the game elements on the web page using the HTML canvas and update the display based on the game state.
- **Extra:** Add sounds, add a timer, styling to look like an arcade game from the 80's. Make it cute :)

## How to play

Use the arrows to control Paperboy. Press the spacebar to throw newspapers.

You must hit the postbox with the newspaper.
